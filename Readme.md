# 📁 DSA Practice

This repository contains DSA codes of mine, written in Python.  
It includes solutions and implementations of key data structures and algorithms, organized by topic.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- 📦 **Arrays**  
  Linear data structure used to store elements at contiguous memory locations.

- 🧵 **Strings**  
  A sequence of characters, often used for problems involving pattern matching, manipulation, or parsing.

- 🔗 **Linked List**  
  A linear data structure where each element points to the next, allowing dynamic memory usage.

- 🔍 **Binary Search**  
  A search algorithm used on sorted arrays/lists with O(log n) complexity.

- 🔁 **Recursion**  
  A method where a function calls itself to solve sub-problems.

- 📚 **Stacks**  
  A LIFO (Last In First Out) structure used in problems like expression parsing, backtracking, etc.

- 📥 **Queues**  
  A FIFO (First In First Out) structure useful in scheduling, BFS, and more.

- 🧮 **Dynamic Programming (1D)**  
  Optimization technique using memoization/tabulation to solve overlapping subproblems efficiently.

- 🚪 **Sliding Window**  
  Technique to reduce time complexity for problems involving contiguous subarrays or substrings.
